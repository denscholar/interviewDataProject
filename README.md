# interviewDataProject

This is a sun=bset of shift data and 'hcp' data. HCPs are 'HealthCare Professionals' (i.e nurses) and HCFs are 'HealthCare facilities'. 'Agent Type' is the type of nurses, 'verified' means a shift was verified as worked by the facility. The shift tab has a record of individual shifts; usually 8hours and the HCPs tab has a record of nurses that worked on our platform.

This data was worked on for some possible insights and discoveries. Major technology used is python and anaconda.
